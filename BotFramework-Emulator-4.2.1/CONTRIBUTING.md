# Contributing

There are many ways to contribute to the Bot Framework Emulator project: reporting issues, submitting pull requests, and creating suggestions.

## Submitting Issues

The Bot Framework Emulator project tracks issues and feature requests using [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/BotBuilder-Emulator/issues).

### Before Submitting an Issue

First, please do a search in open issues to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed. If there is an existing issue, add your comments to that issue.

If your issue is a question, consider asking it on Stack Overflow using the tag `botbuilder`.

### Writing Great Issues and Suggestions
* Provide reproducible steps, what the result of the steps was, and what you would have expected to happen.
* Always file a single bug or feature request per issue. Do not list multiple bugs or requests in the same issue.
* Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.
* Include a screenshot or animated GIF.

Don't feel bad if we can't reproduce the issue and ask you for more information!

## How to build from source

### Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator.git
```

### Navigate to the project
```
cd BotFramework-Emulator
```

### Install global dependencies

> npm version 5.6.0 or greater is required.

```
npm i -g lerna@3.4.0 gulp@4.0.0 gulp-cli@2.0.1 webpack@4.8.x jest
```

> **NOTE:** If you are using Linux, building the Emulator might result in an error due to a missing package: **libXScrnSaver**. If you run into this error, install the package using your OS's package manager and retry: 

>`yum install libXScrnSaver`

### Install local dependencies

```
lerna bootstrap --hoist
```

> **IMPORTANT:** Do **not** run `npm install` in any of the directories; lerna will take care of that for you with the
 `bootstrap` command.

### Build all packages

```
npm run build
```

## How to run & develop locally

There are two, different work flows for local development depending on which part of the project you are working in. 
Refer to the **"Client side development"** section if you are modifying files within the `packages/app/client` 
directory. Refer to the **"Server side development"** section if you are modifying files within both the 
`packages/app/main` & `packages/app/client` directories.

### Run Emulator for local development

Open 2 terminals:

 - One in `packages/app/client` (will be used to start the webpack dev server)
   - run `npm run start`
   - that's all you have to do; you shouldn't have to worry about the client side again unless you modify code in 
   `packages/app/shared` and rebuild the `shared` package
 - Another in `packages/app/main` (will be used to start and restart the main side after changes have been recompiled)
   - run `npm run start:electron:dev`
   - this starts a new instance of the electron app with the most recently compiled `packages/app/main` files
   - **To see app/main file changes:** `Ctrl + C` to kill the electron app, then `npm start:electron:dev` to restart it with your reflected changes

#### If developing locally
In another terminal
 - Navigate to `packages/app/main` (will be used to watch for changes on the main side and auto-compile the TypeScript)
   - run `npm run build:electron -- --watch`
   - don't have to worry about this terminal anymore

### Debugging
#### The Main Process
Running `npm run start:electron:dev` opens up port 7777 for debugging the main node process. Startup is non-blocking
by default which means code could be executed before you have time to attach your debugger and set breakpoints. To prevent this,
change `--inspect=7777` to `--inspect-brk=7777` in the `start:electron` script in the `package.json` located in `packages\app\main`. 
This will prevent code from running until after a debug process has been attached and will require you to start 
the debug process before the emulator is displayed.

Setting up a node debugger depends on your tooling. Please refer to the documentation on setting up a node debugger 
for your flavor of tools. For more information on debugging NodeJS in general, refer to [this guide](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/)

#### The Client
For remote debugging, add `--remote-debugging-port=9222` to the `start:electron` script in the `package.json` located in `packages\app\main`.

## Pull Requests

Before we can accept a pull request from you, you must agree to the 
[Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/). 
It is an automated process and you only need to do this once.

To enable us to quickly review and accept your pull requests, always create one pull request per issue and link the 
issue in the pull request. Never merge multiple requests in one unless they have the same root cause. Keep code changes 
as small as possible. Avoid pure formatting changes to code that has not been modified otherwise.
